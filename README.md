## use of `.copyWith()` method
To promote immutability and clean state management, please use `.copyWith()` implemented in each model when you need to update an object. This allows to create a modified copy with changing the original object.

You only need to pass the parameters you want to change. You can **update more than one parameters at once**.

Refer to these examples to know how to use them.
```dart
// To update a user's first name and last name
final updatedUser = user.copyWith(fname: "First", lname: "Last");

// To change a friend request from pending to accepted
final updatedRequest = request.copyWith(status: "accepted");
```

## go_route
Import the package in your dart file.
```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
```
Add your route in the router configuration in `main.dart`
```dart
final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
  initialLocation: "/",
  routes: [
    ...
    GoRoute(
      path: "/init-travel-styles",
      builder: (context, state) => const InitTravelStylesScreen(),
    ),
    // add it here. like this one above ^^
  ],
);
```

To use it, simply call `.go()`
```dart
context.go('/path');
```

If you need to go insert a screen on top of another screen, (e.g. edit profile page on top of profile page), use `.push()` and `.pop()`
```dart
// push screen on top
context.push('/edit-profile');

// go back
context.pop();
```

And just like `Navigator` you can pass objects inside it. Examples below.
```dart
context.push('/path', userData);
context.pop(userData);
```

## logger
For easy debugging, use the logging system in `utils/logger.dart` instead of printing. 

Import the logger in your dart file.
```dart
import 'package:hakbay/utils/logger.dart';
```

To use, call the appropriate "letter" methods.
```dart
logger.t("trace log");
logger.d("debug log");
logger.i("info log");
logger.w("warning log");
logger.e("error log", error: error);
logger.f("fatal log", error: error, stackTrace: stackTrace);
```
